Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Input the principal amount (P), rate of interest (R), and time (T) in years.
3. Use the formula  to calculate the simple interest.
4. Print the value of SI.
5. Stop.

Pseudocode:
START
PRINT "Enter the principal amount (P):"
INPUT P
PRINT "Enter the rate of interest (R):"
INPUT R
PRINT "Enter the time in years (T):"
INPUT T

SI = (P * R * T) / 100

PRINT "The Simple Interest is:", SI
STOP
