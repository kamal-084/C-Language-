Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Input the number of terms n.
3. Initialize a = 0 (first term) and b = 1 (second term).
4. Print a and b as the first two terms if n >= 2.
5. Repeat the following steps for i from 3 to n:
Calculate the next term c = a + b.
Print c.
Update a = b and b = c.
6. Stop if all terms are printed.

Pseudocode:
START
PRINT "Enter the number of terms (n):"
INPUT n
SET a = 0, b = 1
IF n == 1 THEN
    PRINT a
    STOP
ENDIF
PRINT a, b
FOR i = 3 TO n DO
    SET c = a + b
    PRINT c
    SET a = b
    SET b = c
END FOR
STOP
