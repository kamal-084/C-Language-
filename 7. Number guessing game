Algorithm:
1. Start.
2. Generate a random number between 1 and 100 and store it in randomNumber.
3. Initialize guess to 0.
4. While guess is not equal to randomNumber:
Input the user's guess.
If guess is less than randomNumber, print "Higher."
If guess is greater than randomNumber, print "Lower."
If guess is equal to randomNumber, print "Correct! You guessed the number."
5. End.

Pseudocode :
START
SET randomNumber = GenerateRandomNumber(1, 100)
SET guess = 0

WHILE guess != randomNumber DO
    PRINT "Enter your guess:"
    INPUT guess
    
    IF guess < randomNumber THEN
        PRINT "Higher"
    ELSE IF guess > randomNumber THEN
        PRINT "Lower"
    ELSE
        PRINT "Correct! You guessed the number."
    END IF
END WHILE

STOP
